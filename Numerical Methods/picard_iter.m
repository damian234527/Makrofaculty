function y = picard_iter(fun,y0,iter,xrange)
% Input: fun is a string containing variable(s) x and y such that 
%y' = fun(x,y).  y0 is the initial condition: y(0) = y0.  iter denotes the
%final desired iterate of Picard's algorithm.  xrange denotes the desired
%range to plot the final iteration.
% Output: the function returns y (symbolic expression), the Picard approximation to the solution
% of the first - order differential equation.  a plot of this approximation
% is produced, ranging from xrange(1) to xrange(2).
% Example:  y = picard_iter('x-y',0,5,[0 1]) reutrns the 5th Picard iterate
% of the solution to the differential equation y' = t - y and plots this
% approximation on the interval 0 <= x <= 1.  The zeroeth iterate is simply
% the constant y0.
% Warning:  This code is not optimised to check incompatible user input.
% The user must input a problem statement which is known to have a
% solution.  Also, the code may not work for problems that require
% integration of functions which yield non - elementary functions.
